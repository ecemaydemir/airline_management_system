# Airline Management and Reservation System

A professional Java application built with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Layered Architecture. This project demonstrates enterprise-level software design, focusing on maintainability and scalability.

## Architecture and Design
- **Layered Design:** Organized into Model, Service, and Repository layers to ensure separation of concerns.
- **Data Persistence:** Implements the Repository Pattern for consistent and abstracted file I/O operations.
- **Build System:** Managed with Maven for dependency handling and automated build processes.

## Documentation
The complete architectural blueprint and class relationships are detailed in the following document:
- [Architecture Diagram (UML)](architecture_diagram.pdf)

## Technical Features
- **Encapsulation:** Strong data protection and strict validation logic across all domain entities.
- **Concurrency:** Multi-threaded execution for background report generation and seat reservation simulations.
- **Unit Testing:** Core business logic and pricing engines verified with a comprehensive JUnit 5 test suite.
